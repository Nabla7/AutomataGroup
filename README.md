# Quantum Finite Automata (QFA) Proposal

Quantum Finite Automata (QFA) are a quantum counterpart of classical finite automata, using the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. A QFA can exist in a superposition of states, and its transitions are determined by complex-valued amplitudes rather than probabilities. QFAs have the potential to solve specific problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts.

In this project, we aim to implement a QFA simulator in C++ with a focus on simplicity and elegance, showcasing the nature of QFAs through 8 easy-to-grasp features.

## Features

1. **QFA Definition**: Allow users to define QFAs with a specified number of states, input alphabet, transition function, and acceptance function. The transition function will be represented by a complex-valued matrix, where each entry corresponds to the amplitude of the transition between states for a given input symbol.

$$
\text{Transition Matrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{00} & a_{01} & \cdots & a_{0n} \\
a_{10} & a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m0} & a_{m1} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

2. **QFA Simulation**: Simulate the behavior of QFAs on input strings, updating the amplitudes of states based on the transition matrix and input symbols.

3. **Acceptance Criterion**: Determine if an input string is accepted by the QFA based on the squared norm of the amplitude of the initial state after processing the input string. If the acceptance probability is greater than a specified threshold, the input string is accepted.

$$
P_{accept} = |\alpha_{q_0}|^2
$$

4. **Superposition Visualization**: Provide a visualization tool to help users understand the concept of superposition in QFAs, displaying the amplitudes of states during the simulation process.

5. **Transition Visualization**: Implement a visualization tool to display the state transitions in QFAs based on the input symbols, highlighting the differences between classical and quantum transitions.

6. **Pattern Recognition Example**: Implement a simple QFA example that demonstrates the use of QFAs in pattern recognition tasks, such as recognizing strings with an even number of `0`s.

7. **Palindrome Recognition Example**: Create a QFA example that showcases the ability of QFAs to recognize palindromes, emphasizing the efficiency of quantum computation.

8. **User Manual**: Provide a clear and concise user manual or tutorial to help users understand how to create, simulate, and visualize QFAs using the implemented simulator.

These features will help users explore the unique properties of Quantum Finite Automata while ensuring that the project remains accessible and engaging. By focusing on simplicity and elegance, we can effectively showcase the nature of QFAs and their potential applications in various computational tasks.
